          HumioEventForwardingRule is the Schema for the humioeventforwardingrules API.
          It configures a rule that filters and forwards events from a LogScale repository to an external system.
          NOTE: Event forwarding rules can only be applied to repositories, not views. This is a LogScale API limitation.
