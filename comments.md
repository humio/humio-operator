# Review: Humio PDF Render Service Implementation and Tests

This document captures review notes and suggestions for the newly added PDF render service support in humio-operator. It covers controller behavior, CRD/API surface, TLS handling, autoscaling, tests, chart/RBAC, and alignment with the official LogScale (Humio) documentation for single PDF render service deployments.

## Summary
- The implementation establishes a first-class `HumioPdfRenderService` CRD with a controller that manages a Deployment, Service, optional HPA, and TLS assets (via cert-manager or manual secrets).
- Integration with `HumioCluster` is primarily via environment variables (notably `ENABLE_SCHEDULED_REPORT` and `DEFAULT_PDF_RENDER_SERVICE_URL`), with additional logic to auto-sync TLS if HPRS has no explicit TLS config.
- The test suite is comprehensive but has AfterSuite timeouts due to manager lifecycle/shutdown and envtest/kind interactions.

## Alignment With Humio Docs
- Per the official docs (Deploying Single PDF Render Services), LogScale clusters should:
  - Have scheduled reports enabled: `ENABLE_SCHEDULED_REPORT=true`.
  - Point to the PDF render service via `DEFAULT_PDF_RENDER_SERVICE_URL`.
- The repo mirrors this: tests set `ENABLE_SCHEDULED_REPORT` and `DEFAULT_PDF_RENDER_SERVICE_URL` on HumioCluster pods (e.g. `internal/controller/suite/clusters/humiocluster_controller_test.go:326`).
- Recommendation: document, in the repo README/CRD docs, the minimal integration steps for LogScale users, explicitly naming these env vars and a short end-to-end example.

## Controller: Key Observations & Improvements
- Env vars used by PDF service container:
  - TLS envs are modeled as `TLS_ENABLED`, `TLS_CERT_PATH`, `TLS_KEY_PATH`, `TLS_CA_PATH` (internal/controller/humiopdfrenderservice_controller.go:42–45). This matches the intent for the current container image, but confirm they align exactly with the PDF service image contract (image docs/config). If the image expects different names (e.g. `CA_CERT_FILE`), adapt here.
- Pod hashing and reconcile skip logic are robust: sanitization + hash annotation (HPRSPodSpecHashAnnotation) avoids spurious updates.
- Scaling behavior:
  - The code comments state the service should scale down to 0 when no `HumioCluster` has `ENABLE_SCHEDULED_REPORT=true` (internal/controller/humiopdfrenderservice_controller.go:260–262), but that policy is not implemented. Currently, scaled-down state is only set when `spec.replicas == 0` (internal/controller/humiopdfrenderservice_controller.go:460–468).
  - Recommendation: either implement the intended auto-scale-down policy (discover clusters, if none with scheduled reports, set desired replicas to 0 when HPA disabled), or remove/clarify the comment to avoid drift.
- Status conditions are well structured and updated via conflict-retry (internal/controller/humiopdfrenderservice_controller.go:2149+). Consider adding a TLS-related condition (e.g. `TLSReady`) to surface certificate/issuer readiness distinctly.

## TLS Model
- Auto-sync TLS from a PDF-enabled HumioCluster when HPRS lacks explicit TLS (internal/controller/humiopdfrenderservice_controller.go:133–219) is a nice touch that matches practical setups.
- CA handling and volumes:
  - Server cert secret and mount at `/etc/tls` and CA at `/etc/ca`; env vars provide file paths to the container (internal/controller/humiopdfrenderservice_controller.go:1560–1640). Ensure the PDF service image indeed reads from those envs/paths.
- cert-manager integration:
  - Watches/Owns `Issuer`/`Certificate` when cert-manager is enabled; FSGroup is set for secret volume readability (internal/controller/humiopdfrenderservice_controller.go:1272–1292). Good.
- Recommendations:
  - Validate endpoint schemes for probes toggle between HTTP/HTTPS based on TLS (already done), and ensure the Service port/targets match the image defaults.
  - Add explicit validation errors in status when TLS is enabled but the CA secret is missing/invalid (errors are returned; consider surfacing via a status condition for user visibility).

## Environment Variables & Integration
- Humio side:
  - Tests validate `ENABLE_SCHEDULED_REPORT=true` and `DEFAULT_PDF_RENDER_SERVICE_URL` in Humio pods (internal/controller/suite/clusters/humiocluster_controller_test.go:338–357 and subsequent assertions).
  - There’s a comment referencing `PDF_RENDER_SERVICE_CALLBACK_BASE_URL` (internal/controller/humiocluster_defaults.go:497) but it is not wired. If current LogScale versions use this callback env var, consider adding it to `HumioCluster` defaults or making it configurable in the CRD/spec, ideally tied to the cluster’s `PUBLIC_URL`/`EXTERNAL_URL` where appropriate.
- PDF service side:
  - Confirm if the PDF service needs any Humio base URL env var to call back (e.g., some images need `HUMIO_BASE_URL`); if so, ensure we expose a way to set it, or derive from cluster settings.
- Documentation:
  - Add a short “How to connect HumioCluster to PDF service” section that shows the env vars, service DNS naming example, and TLS on/off variants (self-signed CA vs. public CA).

## HPA and Scaling
- HPA support is implemented and tested:
  - Multiple metrics, default CPU utilization target when unspecified (internal/controller/humiopdfrenderservice_controller.go:1216–1254) with coverage in tests.
- Recommendations:
  - Validate HPA min/max constraints at reconcile-time and surface config errors via status.
  - Consider reconciling `spec.replicas` only when HPA is disabled (already followed), and document the interaction explicitly in CRD docs.

## Probes & Ports
- Defaults `/health` and `/ready` (api/v1alpha1/humiopdfrenderservice_types.go:35–38). Probes derive scheme from TLS enabled state (internal/controller/humiopdfrenderservice_controller.go:1456–1499, 1501–1547).
- Recommendations:
- Double-check these endpoints and port (default 5123) match the official PDF service image. If the docs mention different paths/ports, align defaults here and in chart values.

## RBAC & Charts
- Chart RBAC includes HPA and conditional cert-manager permissions (charts/humio-operator/templates/rbac/cluster-roles.yaml). Good.
- Recommendations:
  - Ensure the Helm chart surfaces `defaultPdfRenderServiceImage` and any TLS knobs in `values.yaml`, with examples.
  - Provide a sample manifest that creates an HPRS with TLS disabled, plus a HumioCluster with `ENABLE_SCHEDULED_REPORT` and `DEFAULT_PDF_RENDER_SERVICE_URL`.

## Test Suite
- Coverage highlights:
  - Independent deployment behavior and Humio integration (internal/controller/suite/pfdrenderservice/humiopdfrenderservice_controller_test.go:56–178, 139–214).
  - Update/image & resource/probe configuration; HPA on/off and multi-metric; reconcile idempotency for `ImagePullPolicy`.
  - TLS sync from HumioCluster (auto-enable), explicit TLS preserved, no sync when PDF disabled, and cleanup of issuer/secrets when disabling TLS.
- Pending/skipped tests:
  - Tests around `PDF_RENDER_SERVICE_CALLBACK_BASE_URL` are marked pending (XIt) (internal/controller/suite/pfdrenderservice/humiopdfrenderservice_controller_test.go:687–699). Either implement the feature or move these to the cluster suite (or delete to avoid false expectations).
  - cert-manager-dependent specs are skipped when not available. That’s appropriate.
- AfterSuite timeouts:
  - The logs show repeated suite timeouts during `AfterSuite` at `testEnv.Stop()` while the manager goroutine is still running (e.g., internal/controller/suite/pfdrenderservice/suite_test.go:177 and goroutines waiting in controller-runtime process stop). Root cause is the manager being started with `ctrl.SetupSignalHandler()` and never explicitly stopped, while envtest stop waits/block.
  - Recommendation: manage the manager lifecycle with a cancelable context:
    - In `BeforeSuite`, use `ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())` and `go k8sManager.Start(ctx)` instead of `SetupSignalHandler()`.
    - In `AfterSuite`, call `cancel()` before `testEnv.Stop()` and optionally wait for the manager to stop. This typically resolves Ginkgo AfterSuite timeouts in parallel.
  - Also ensure namespace teardown does not block (use Eventually to wait for deletion and avoid assert immediately before shutdown).

## API/CRD Surface
- Spec fields are sensible (image, replicas, resources, probes, TLS, autoscaling, volumes/mounts, SA, pullSecrets, annotations). Defaults are set (api/v1alpha1/humiopdfrenderservice_types.go:300+).
- Recommendations:
  - Add OpenAPI validation for `replicas >= 0`, and for HPA `maxReplicas >= minReplicas >= 1` (kubebuilder markers), so invalid configs are rejected early.
  - Consider adding `serviceAnnotations` to HPRS spec (service annotations are already used in constructDesiredService; ensure CRD exposes it).
  - Consider exposing an optional `env` field specifically for the PDF container to allow overriding without mixing with internal TLS envs.

## Observed Minor Issues/Polish
- Comments indicating behavior that isn’t implemented (auto scale-down with no PDF-enabled clusters) – either implement or update comments/tests to avoid confusion.
- Duplicated helper snippets in controller file (ensure no accidental duplication crept in during merges; the file reads clean but worth a quick pass).
- Logging: consider reducing debug logs or gating them behind a verbose level once stabilized.

## Prioritized Action Items
1. Fix test shutdown to eliminate `AfterSuite` timeouts (manager context cancel before `testEnv.Stop()`).
2. Confirm image contract for TLS env var names and probe endpoints; adjust defaults if needed.
3. Decide on (and implement) the advertised policy for auto scale-down when no clusters have `ENABLE_SCHEDULED_REPORT=true`, or remove that comment.
4. Wire or drop `PDF_RENDER_SERVICE_CALLBACK_BASE_URL` support. If keeping, expose a way to configure it from `HumioCluster` (possibly derived from `PUBLIC_URL`) and add tests.
5. Add CRD validation markers for replicas/HPA bounds; consider a `TLSReady` status condition.
6. Update repo docs with a minimal, copy-paste example covering: independent HPRS, HumioCluster env vars (with and without TLS), and service DNS patterns.
